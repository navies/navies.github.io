I'm a CS Masters student at the [University of
Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) supervised by Professor [Kimon
Fountoulakis](http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kfount/). My research
interests are in machine learning, data science and optimization. I
completed my Masters in Pure Mathematics at the University of Waterloo
under the supervision of [Ben
Webster](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/b2webste/home). Prior to that, I
did my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and the Mathematics at
the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en) where I had the
opportunity to be supervised by [Alistair
Savage](https://alistairsavage.ca/).
